# Uwuify.Humanizer

An extension method for strings to convert it into the UwU variant.

The class library is made to be the main focus of this repository, with the other projects (ConsoleApp and Benchmarks) being purely supplemental. 

## Usage

```cs
using Uwuify.Humanizer

string myString = "Hello World!".Uwuify();

// myString: "hewwo w-wowwd *:･ﾟ✧*:･ﾟ✧  t-this i-is my exampwe usage of this cuwsed humanyizew extenysiony (≧◡≦)"
```
